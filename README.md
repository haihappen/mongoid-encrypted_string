# mongoid-encrypted_string

`Mongoid::EncryptedString` defines a EncryptedString type for your Mongoid apps, which provides you a simple way to store encrypted information in your database.

`Mongoid::EncryptedString` uses `Gibberish::AES` internally to encrypt your data.

## Installation

In your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'mongoid-encrypted_string'
```

Add an initializer:

```ruby
Mongoid::EncryptedString.config.key = 'random'
```

## Usage

```ruby
class Document
  include Mongoid::Document

  field :string, type: Mongoid::EncryptedString
ends
```

```ruby
document = Document.create string: 'secret'
document.attributes => {"_id"=>"50e92506372fa248a6000002",
 "string"=>
  "U2FsdGVkX19oLIvsPM0WtUiqyFwp/TPOk5x5t/5S5q4qDkGqcoWy7FKtkxvj\nicT5\n" }
```

If you want to use `EncryptedString` directly instead of `Mongoid::EncryptedString`:

```ruby
class Document
  include Mongoid::Document

  field :string, type: EncryptedString
end
```

â€¦ your Gemfile must include a additional require statement:

```ruby
gem 'mongoid-encrypted_string', require: 'mongoid/encrypted_string/global'
```
